## 🖼️ Project Screenshots

Create screenshots of your projects and place them in `/public/`:
- `screen1.png` - Fintrion dashboard
- `screen2.png` - Axenyx interface
- `screen3.png` - LeafX app
- `screen4.png` - BSO UTA system

**Recommended size**: 1170 x 2532 px (iPhone) or 3024 x 1964 px (MacBook)

## 🔍 Model Requirements

### The model must have:
- ✅ GLB/GLTF format (not FBX or OBJ)
- ✅ A mesh named "Screen" or "Display" (for texture mapping)
- ✅ PBR materials (metalness, roughness)
- ✅ Realistic proportions

### If the model doesn't have a "Screen" mesh:
1. Open the model in Blender
2. Find the screen mesh and rename it to "Screen"
3. Export as GLB

Or tell me the mesh names and I'll update the code!
